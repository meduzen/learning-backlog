# Partial learning backlog

In the [issues](https://github.com/meduzen/learning-backlog/issues) of this repo, I list some stuff I would like to give a look at some point. It’s a partial backlog, meaning there are stuff where I have interest that are not listed here.

You’re free to ask questions, comment or give recommandations in these issues.

This list was initially started using Basecamp in June 2020, and was migrated to GitHub during Summer 2025.
