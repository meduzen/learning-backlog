# Partial learning backlog

In the [issues](https://github.com/meduzen/learning-backlog/issues) of this repo, I list some stuff I would like to give a look at some point. It’s a partial backlog, meaning there are stuff where I have interest that are not listed here.

You’re free to ask questions, comment or give recommandations in these issues.

This list was initially started using Basecamp in June 2020, and was migrated to GitHub during Summer 2025.

# Motivations to use GitHub

- I often use GitHub and I even have the app on my phone, so it’s more reachable than other systems that would log me out after some time. Proof: I’m writing this section from my phone.
- GitHub issues are a good place for tracking and categorizing (using labels) this kind of backlog.
- I can make it public or private easily.
- Other developers can comment or ask questions, and a lot of them use GitHub.

So for now I’ll stick with GitHub.
