# Partial learning backlog

In the [issues](https://github.com/meduzen/learning-backlog/issues) of this repo, I list some stuff I would like to give a look at some point. It‚Äôs a partial backlog: most things interesting me are not in it. Browsing [by labels](https://github.com/meduzen/learning-backlog/labels) can be a good idea.

## History

This list was initially started using Basecamp in June 2020, and was migrated to GitHub during Summer 2025. Aside from issues 1 and 32, all issues until _to complete once everything migrated_ are the ones migrated.

> [!WARNING]
> List not fully migrated yet. Around 35 items remaining.

## Why is it public?

This list is public, this way other developers can comment, ask questions or watch the repository to be notified when I add something.

If you do something similar, let me know! ‚úåÔ∏è I think it‚Äôs a nice way to discover new things.

## How I proceed

I have a bunch of side projects (some public, some private), so each time I start learning something, I usually have at least 1 candidate project where this learning can be applied. It has been proven effective for me, because there‚Äôs nothing better as real use cases to test the extent of something, and see if it bring additional constraints or curiosities.

In some issues like [this one](https://github.com/meduzen/learning-backlog/issues/35), I make a checklist of projects where I can test the related thing. If there is no project mentioned, it can mean 4 things:

- not relevant for the issue
- not decided yet
- no candidates among my public projects, but maybe among my private projects
- no candidates at all üò¢

## Motivations to use GitHub

- I often use GitHub and I even have the app on my phone, so it‚Äôs more reachable than other systems that would log me out after some time. Proof: I‚Äôm writing this section from my phone.
- GitHub issues are a good place for tracking and categorizing (using labels) this kind of backlog.
- I can make it public or private easily.
- See [_Why is it public?_](#why-is-it-public).

So for now I‚Äôll stick with GitHub.
